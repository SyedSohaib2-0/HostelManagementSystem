Hostel Management System 

1.	Project Overview

The Hostel Management System is a comprehensive JavaFX application designed to manage various aspects of hostel operations. The system provides functionality for managing students, staff, rooms, allocations, payments, and maintenance reports through an intuitive graphical user interface.




2. System Architecture
2.1 Technology Stack
Programming Language: Java
UI Framework: JavaFX
UI Definition: FXML
Styling: CSS
Database Connectivity: JDBC



2.2 Application Structure
The application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern:
Model: Database entities (Students, Staff, Rooms, etc.)
View: FXML files defining the UI layout
Controller: Java classes handling user interactions and business logic

3. Module Descriptions
3.1 Main Dashboard

The main dashboard serves as the central navigation hub of the application. It provides buttons to access all the management modules:

Student Management
Staff Management
Room Management
Allocation Management
Payment Management
Maintenance Reports

The dashboard is defined in MainDashboard.fxml and controlled by MainDashboardController.java.
 
3.2 Student Management

The Student Management module allows administrators to:

Add new students with details (registration number, name, gender, email, phone, room ID, course, join date, end date)
Update existing student information
Delete student records
Search for students by registration number
The module validates room IDs against the database to ensure they exist before assigning students.

 


3.3 Staff Management
The Staff Management module provides functionality to:

Add new staff members with their details
Update staff information
Delete staff records

Search for staff by ID

3.4 Room Management
The Room Management module enables:
Adding new rooms with room number and capacity
Updating room details
Deleting room records
Searching for rooms by room number

3.5 Allocation Management
This module handles the allocation of rooms to students:

Assign students to specific rooms
Record allocation dates
Update or remove allocations
View allocation details
3.6 Payment Management
The Payment Management module tracks financial transactions:
Record payments made by students
Specify payment amounts and dates
Search payment history
Generate payment reports










3.7 Maintenance Management
This module allows for:
Reporting maintenance issues for specific rooms
Tracking issue status
Recording resolution details
Viewing maintenance history










4. Database Structure
The application connects to a database with the following tables:
students
staff
rooms
allocations
payments
maintenance_reports
The database connection is managed through the DatabaseConnection class, which provides methods for establishing and closing connections.
 
SQL CODE: 

CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS hostel1_db1;
USE hostel1_db1;


CREATE TABLE room_type (
    type_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    description VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE rooms (
    room_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    type_id INT,
    room_number VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    availability ENUM('Available', 'Occupied') DEFAULT 'Available',
    capacity INT NOT NULL,
    current_occupants INT DEFAULT 0,
    FOREIGN KEY (type_id) REFERENCES room_type(type_id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);

CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    reg_no VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    gender ENUM('Male', 'Female') NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100),
    phone VARCHAR(20),
    course VARCHAR(100),
    join_date DATE,
    end_date DATE,
    room_id INT,
    photo_path VARCHAR(255),
    FOREIGN KEY (room_id) REFERENCES rooms(room_id) ON DELETE SET NULL
);
CREATE TABLE staff (
    staff_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    role VARCHAR(100),
    phone VARCHAR(20),
    email VARCHAR(100)
);

CREATE TABLE maintenance 
(
    maintenance_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    room_id INT NOT NULL,
    issue TEXT NOT NULL,
    reported_date DATE NOT NULL,
    resolved_date DATE,
    status ENUM('Pending', 'In Progress', 'Completed') DEFAULT 'Pending',
    FOREIGN KEY (room_id) REFERENCES rooms(room_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- 1. Students with room number:
    SELECT s.*, r.room_number FROM students s LEFT JOIN rooms r ON s.room_id = r.room_id;

-- 2. Maintenance with room number:
  SELECT m.*, r.room_number FROM maintenance m JOIN rooms r ON m.room_id = r.room_id;

-- 3. All available rooms:
    SELECT * FROM rooms WHERE availability = 'Available';

-- 4. Room occupancy check:
  SELECT room_number, capacity, current_occupants FROM rooms;

-- 5. All staff:
  SELECT * FROM staff;

-- 6. Specific student by reg_no:
SELECT s.*, r.room_number FROM students s LEFT JOIN rooms r ON s.room_id = r.room_id WHERE s.reg_no = 'REG123';

-- 7. Get full room details including type:
  SELECT r.*, rt.description FROM rooms r LEFT JOIN room_type rt ON r.type_id = rt.type_id;

5. User Interface Design
The user interface is designed with a clean, modern look using JavaFX components styled with CSS. Key UI features include:

Consistent blue color scheme (#4285F4)
Responsive buttons with hover effects
Form validation with error alerts
Navigation between modules
Text fields with focus effects
Clean typography using "Segoe UI" font family
6. How to Run the Application
6.1 Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher
JavaFX libraries (included in JDK 8-10, separate download for JDK 11+)
MySQL or another compatible database server
Maven 
6.2 Database Setup
Create a new database named hostel1_db1.
Execute the SQL script to create the required tables (script not provided in the files)
Update database connection parameters in the DatabaseConnection class if necessary


6.3 Running the Application
if using an IDE like Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA:
Import the project
Set up the project dependencies (JavaFX libraries)
Run the MainApp class
6.4 Testing Database Connection
You can test the database connection by running the DBTest class:


java -cp bin com.hostel1.DBTest  

10. Conclusion
The Hostel Management System provides a comprehensive solution for managing hostel operations
. Its modular design allows for easy maintenance and future enhancements.
The intuitive user interface ensures that administrators can efficiently manage all aspects of hostel operations from a single application.
